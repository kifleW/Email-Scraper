Make sure you have python, npm, and pip installed.

Then install the packages below using pip:
  1.selanium
  2.requests

Install the web-client phantomjs using npm. Make sure your path is correctly set
to phantomjs before use.

There is also an option to use firefox instead of phantomjs by commenting out
and commenting a line in the source code. To take advantage of said option,
make sure firefox is installed.
